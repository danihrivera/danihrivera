### Hi there, I'm [Daniel](https://leonnoel.com) 👋🏽

By day, I write code for my career as software engineers, you can find my proyects in my [Web]()

By night, I like write some ideas of technology in my [Blog]()

By every other hour, you can find me on [Discord](), [Twitch](), and [Youtube]() helping folks learn to code and share some proyects with my friends!

I’m currently learning here.
